# age.java

Write a Java program that will display different messages depending on your age. Your program should ask the user for his/her name and their age in years and give one or more answers from the following ones below: 

if the age of the user is less than 16, the program should print on the screen "You are not allowed to drive at the moment."
if the age of the user is less than 18, the program should print on the screen "You are not allowed to vote at the moment."
if the age of the user is less than 25, the program should print on the screen "You are not allowed to rent a car at the moment.
if the age of the user is greater than or equal with 25,the program  should print on the screen "You can do anything that is legal."
Here is a sample run for these restrictions. Notice that a person which is under 16 will display all the three messages above, one for being under 16, one for also being under 18, and one for also being under 25.
